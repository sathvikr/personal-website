            <p>I’m launching <a href="https://getinstachip.com">Instachip</a> at Stanford, with Jag Maddipatla.
                Instachip is a Copilot for FPGA programming, except its code suggestions are always right, because we use a better algorithm.</p>
            <p>Previously, I designed semiconductor chips for ~3 years. Jag and I built Tachyon, a chip for O(1) matrix-vector multiplication. 
                Also, we created a concept for an Optical Vector Processor, which is like a GPU but with silicon photonics (US18119437, pending).</p> 
            <p>I've also built programming languages, compilers, and interpreters for ~6 years. My favorite is Apollo, which</p>
            <ul>
                <li>is a tensor algebra DSL</li>
                <li>compiles to an optical processor</li>
                <li>stores sparse tensors better than NumPy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before Apollo, I implemented a regex interpreter using Brzozowski derivatives, a two-stage compiler for the Jack language (following <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686">this textbook</a>), and an interpreter for RED, my first programming language, which I made when I was 12.</p>
            <p><b>Other projects I managed to salvage:</b> An AI chess engine, Sudoku solver, a CV algorithm to count physical money (from scratch), edge detection (from scratch), implementing a tiny neural net (from scratch), an Othello engine, augmented reality chessboard, TicTacToe engine, basic cipher cracker, AI Tetris solver, some train stuff, toy syntax analyzers, Graham scan, a hands-free computer interface, a puzzle solver, Calibron engine, a word ladder solver, an image vectorizer, search engine, file sharing app, and an AI for the Ghost word game.</p>
            <p><b>P.S.</b>, I also made an <a href="">electric guitar from scratch</a>, and a few <a href="">EMP generators</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Second favorite book:</b> <i>Zero to One</i>, Peter Thiel</p>
            <p><b>Projects I’m procrastinating, due to the startup grind:</b> Photonic backend for <a href="https://github.com/apache/tvm">Apache TVM</a>, Verilog compiler, no-code Verilog editor</p>
            <p><b>Books I'm procrastinating, due to the startup grind:</b> <i>Art of Computer Programming</i>, Donald Knuth</p>
