            <p>A new field I invented called “computational poetry.”

                Recently, I started a linguistic experiment because I thought poetry was a scam. I wrote many poems by acting like an anti-LLM (each word has minimal correlation with previous words). My hypothesis was that people would consider the poems to be hot garbage. But my AP English teacher loved them. So did my classmates. I then wrote a few poems by rigorously following techniques taught in my classes. Unsurprisingly, no one liked them.
                
                I think humans associate randomness with creativity. For example, take the following verse:
                
                “ChatGPT, yellow, tomorrow, windowsill.
                And queerly the sun sets.”
                
                Brilliant! This means computers might be able to write better poems than humans. A few cleverly-worded GPT-4o prompts gave me the following:
                
                “Sunrise whispers softly;
                In dreams, shadows wane.”
                
                Meh. I’ll build a working “anti-LLM” soon.
