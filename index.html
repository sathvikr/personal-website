            <p>I’m launching <a href="https://getinstachip.com">Instachip</a> at Stanford, with Jag Maddipatla.
                Instachip is a Copilot for FPGA programming, except its code suggestions are always right, because we use a better algorithm.
                We think this could evolve into an AI agent that can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA7YH4XT1s0&t=5s">autonomously design chips</a>.
            </p>
            <p>If you're into chips, FPGAs, or being a miscellaneous hardware geek, check out <a href="https://opensourcechips.org">OpenChips</a>! It's an open source repository for chip design.
                Chips are becoming very important and <a href="https://github.com/getinstachip/openchips">this repository</a> could play an interesting role...

            <p>Previously, I designed semiconductor chips for ~3 years. Jag and I built Tachyon, a chip for O(1) matrix-vector multiplication, and designed the Vector Processing Unit (US18119437, pending).</p>
                
                <p>I've built programming languages, compilers, and interpreters for ~6 years. My favorite is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06749">Apollo</a>, 
                a tensor algebra DSL that compiles to an optical processor and stores sparse tensors better than NumPy. Before Apollo, I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/sathvikr/ai-stuff/tree/main/regex_compiler%20(finite%20automata%20%2B%20browzowski%20derivative)">
                regex interpreter using Brzozowski derivatives</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/sathvikr/nand2tetris/tree/main/JackCompiler/src">
                    compiler for the Jack programming language</a> (following <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686">
                        this textbook</a>), and an interpreter for RED, my first programming language, which I made when I was 12.</p>
